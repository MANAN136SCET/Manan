## Challenge : PACE IN THE CLASSROOM
### Challenge Name: PACE IN THE CLASSROOM
We are working on the Pace in the Classroom challenge, which focuses on making complex data from NASA’s PACE satellite accessible and engaging for students worldwide. Our goal is to create digestible educational materials that help integrate this data into classroom curriculums, improving ocean literacy globally.

## Challenge Overview
The Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) satellite launched on February 8, 2024, and has been gathering vital data about Earth’s oceans and atmosphere since April 11, 2024. Through NASA’s open science policy, this data is available to the public, but understanding it can be challenging for those unfamiliar with it.

Our project aims to bridge this gap by developing kid-friendly, engaging materials that teachers can use across various grade levels. We’re focusing on turning PACE’s scientific data, gathered from instruments like the Ocean Color Instrument (OCI), SPEXone polarimeter, and Hyper-Angular Rainbow Polarimeter #2 (HARP2), into resources that spark curiosity and foster ocean literacy. These materials will showcase the importance of phytoplankton, ocean-atmosphere exchanges, aerosols, and more, making complex topics accessible to young learners.
